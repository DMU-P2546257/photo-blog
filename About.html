    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I am Francesca and currently studying Media Production at De Montford University.
      My passion is photography and I do photography while studying. I am based in Derbyshire,
      England. Passion for photography began from early age and I was fascinated with cameras.
      I got my first camera when I was 16. I was eager to start shooting photos. I decided to
      walk around my local area which at the time was Louth, Lincolnshire. The area had a lot
      of hiking areas and green scenery. I would spend the whole day to capture the best photo.
      The lighting, weather and timing are the most important things to know about photography.
      My favourite lighting is the sunrise and autumn season because the colours from autumn leaves
      and the bright orange from the sunrise gives any photo dramatic tone. Whatever the weather or
      time of day I want to capture moment and look back at the photo.
    </p>

    <p>Max Rive is my inspiration photographer. I have learned techniques and information from Max.
      His passion is mountains and landscapes photography. I have published some of my photos on a
      postcard of Louth in Lincolnshire and postcards were sold in the Louth Museum. The photos were
      of the St James church which is icon for Louth and the old memorial buildings.Something as
      little as a postcard means a lot and first step into getting notice for my photography.
